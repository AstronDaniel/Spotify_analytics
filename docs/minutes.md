Crop Disease Detection System Proposal
Presented by: Sempala Daniel
•Proposed an AI-based crop disease detection system
•Explained the potential impact on agriculture
•Suggested using image processing and machine learning
•Described the basic workflow of the system

Discussion Points Raised:
•Concerns about the complexity of ML implementation
•Questions about acquiring training data
•Discussed timeline feasibility

Group Debate
Key Discussion Points
1.Technical Complexity
•Skills Platform: Moderate complexity, mainly in matching algorithms
•Spotify Analytics: Lower complexity, well-documented API
•Crop Detection: Highest complexity, requires ML expertise

2.Team Skills Match
•Assessed current team knowledge of required technologies
•Discussed learning opportunities
•Evaluated distribution of work

3.Framework Considerations
